title: "Methodology and Limitations"

## Approach

This project uses a **descriptive, comparative** approach. It does not attempt
to estimate causal effects. The goal is to document patterns in the data
and to understand what different measures of inequality actually capture.

Where the analysis involves statistical relationships (e.g., Gini vs. life
expectancy), these are presented as correlations, not causal claims. The text
discusses the causal debate but does not take a strong position.

## Key methodological choices

### Income concepts

The World Inequality Database provides three income concepts:

- **Factor income**: Labor + capital income before any government intervention
- **Pre-tax national income**: Factor income + pensions and social insurance,
  before income tax
- **Post-tax disposable income**: After all taxes and cash transfers

The choice of concept matters enormously. Pre-tax inequality is much higher
than post-tax inequality in redistributive countries (Nordics) but similar in
the US. Most analysis in this project uses both pre-tax and post-tax to show
how redistribution changes the picture.

### PPP adjustment

Cross-country income comparisons use Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange
rates, which adjust for differences in price levels. WID reports income in
local currency; we convert using WID's own PPP factors (`xlcuspi999`),
matched to the year of the income data to avoid inflation distortion.

PPP adjustment is essential for global comparisons but imperfect — it assumes
a common consumption basket that may not reflect actual spending patterns in
different countries.

### Unit of analysis

WID uses **equal-split adults** as the default unit: household income is
divided equally between adult members. This means a single person earning
\$60k and a couple each earning \$30k are treated the same. This is a
reasonable default but masks within-household inequality.

### Country selection

The core seven countries (US, UK, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway)
were chosen to represent different positions on the inequality-redistribution
spectrum among rich democracies. They are not a random sample of anything.

The expanded set in Notebook 07 adds countries across income tiers but is
still a convenience sample, not a comprehensive survey.

## Known limitations

1. **WID data quality varies by country.** Data for the US, France, and
   Nordics are based on comprehensive tax records. Data for many developing
   countries rely on surveys with known undercoverage of top incomes.

2. **Cross-sectional analysis cannot establish causation.** The correlation
   between inequality and poor health outcomes could reflect reverse causation,
   confounding, or the concavity of the income-health relationship.

3. **The "social wage" is invisible.** Nordic countries provide extensive
   public services (healthcare, education, childcare) that don't appear in
   disposable income statistics. Comparing cash income understates the
   living standards of lower-income Scandinavians relative to Americans.

4. **Happiness data is noisy.** The Cantril Ladder is a single survey question
   with significant measurement error. Cross-country comparisons may be
   affected by cultural differences in response styles.

5. **Small N problem.** With 7 core countries (or 23 in the expanded set),
   statistical power is limited. A single outlier (the US) can drive or
   destroy correlations.

6. **Time period sensitivity.** Most cross-sectional comparisons use ~2019
   data. Results may differ for other years, and the COVID-19 pandemic
   has disrupted many indicators.

## Time-series analysis (Notebook 08)

Notebook 08 examines the Easterlin Paradox: whether countries that get
richer over time also get happier. This introduces three additional data
sources:

- **Gallup World Poll / Cantril Ladder** (via Our World in Data): ~2005–2024,
  130+ countries. The same 0–10 scale used in Notebook 07, but now as a
  time series rather than a cross-sectional snapshot.
- **US General Social Survey (GSS)**: 1972–present. A 3-category happiness
  question ("very happy," "pretty happy," "not too happy"). The canonical
  dataset for the Easterlin Paradox.
- **World Values Survey / European Values Study**: 1981–2022, ~100 countries
  surveyed in 7 waves. Life satisfaction on a 1–10 scale. The longest
  available multi-country time series.

Key limitations specific to the time-series analysis:

- **Ordinal scales**: The GSS 3-point scale cannot distinguish cardinal
  changes in well-being. Different assumptions about the spacing between
  categories can produce different trend conclusions (Bond & Lang 2025).
- **Short vs. long run**: Business-cycle fluctuations in GDP are correlated
  with happiness changes, but sustained long-run growth may not be
  (Easterlin & O'Connor 2020). Time horizon matters.
- **WVS coverage is intermittent**: Countries are surveyed in waves (~every
  5 years), not annually, making precise trend estimation difficult.
- **Cultural response bias**: Cross-country comparisons of subjective scales
  may be affected by culturally different norms around expressing satisfaction.

## Labor market analysis (Notebook 09)

Notebook 09 examines labor force participation and working hours across
countries, using three additional data sources:

- **Our World in Data / Penn World Table** (working hours): Average annual
  hours per person engaged. PWT provides data for 185 countries from
  1950 onward; historical data from Huberman & Minns (2007) extends select
  countries back to 1870.
- **World Bank** (labor force participation): Total, male, and female
  participation rates from the ILO-modeled estimates. Coverage: 1990-2024,
  most countries.
- **Approximate productivity**: GDP per hour worked is computed as
  GDP per capita divided by (labor force participation rate x hours per worker).
  This is an approximation that assumes employment rate equals participation
  rate. True GDP-per-hour data from the OECD is more precise but covers
  fewer countries.

Key limitations specific to the labor analysis:

- **Economy-wide averages**: Average hours per worker masks enormous
  variation within countries — between full-time and part-time workers,
  formal and informal sectors, and different occupations.
- **Historical data covers only production workers**: Pre-1950 data from
  Huberman & Minns measures full-time workers in non-agricultural activities,
  not the full economy.
- **Informal work**: In developing countries, labor force participation
  rates undercount informal work, especially women's unpaid domestic labor.
  Cross-country comparisons must be interpreted cautiously.
- **Causation vs. correlation**: The relationship between inequality and
  working hours could run in either direction or be driven by common
  causes (labor market institutions, tax policy, cultural norms).

## Reproducibility

All code is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/clayborneo/inequality-inquiry).
Data are fetched from public APIs (World Bank, WID, OWID) and cached locally.
To reproduce the analysis:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clayborneo/inequality-inquiry.git
cd income-inequality
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/*.ipynb
```

The cache layer (`data/cache.py`) stores API responses as parquet files
to avoid repeated downloads. Clear the cache with `python -c "from data.cache import clear_cache; clear_cache()"`.
