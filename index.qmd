title: "Inequality: An Open Investigation"
subtitle: "What do the data actually say about inequality, well-being, and the distribution of income?"

## What is this?

This is an open research project that uses publicly available data to investigate
income and wealth inequality. It started as a personal attempt to understand
the empirical landscape — what's well-established, what's contested, and where
the data run out.

The analysis spans seven notebooks, each tackling a different question:

| Notebook | Question |
|----------|----------|
| [01: Measuring Inequality](notebooks/01_measuring_inequality.ipynb) | How do we measure inequality, and do different measures tell different stories? |
| [02: Predistribution vs. Redistribution](notebooks/02_predistribution_vs_redistribution.ipynb) | Is inequality driven by market outcomes or by tax/transfer policy? |
| [03: Absolute vs. Relative](notebooks/03_absolute_vs_relative.ipynb) | Are the poor getting poorer, or just falling behind? |
| [04: Wealth vs. Income](notebooks/04_wealth_vs_income.ipynb) | How does wealth inequality compare to income inequality? |
| [05: Inequality and Society](notebooks/05_inequality_and_society.ipynb) | Does inequality damage health and social outcomes? |
| [06: Synthesis](notebooks/06_synthesis.ipynb) | What can we conclude from the full picture? |
| [07: Well-being Across Distributions](notebooks/07_wellbeing_across_distributions_executed.ipynb) | How does well-being vary across the global income spectrum? |

## Data sources

All data are drawn from public sources:

- **[World Inequality Database (WID)](https://wid.world/)** — Income and wealth
  distributions from tax and survey data, harmonized across countries.
- **[SWIID](https://fsolt.org/swiid/)** — Standardized World Income Inequality
  Database, providing comparable Gini coefficients.
- **[World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/)** — Health, education, poverty,
  and national accounts indicators.
- **[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)** — Subjective well-being
  (Cantril Ladder / World Happiness Report).

## Countries covered

The core analysis compares seven rich countries with different policy regimes:
**US, UK, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway**.

Notebook 07 expands to ~24 countries spanning the global income spectrum, from
Norway and the US to Ethiopia and Bangladesh.

**If you're not technical:** Click any notebook link above. The code is folded
by default — you'll just see the text, charts, and analysis. Click "Show code"
on any chart if you want to see how it was made.

**If you are technical:** The full source code is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/clayborneo/inequality-inquiry). Clone the repo, install
`requirements.txt`, and run the notebooks yourself. Every chart is reproducible.

## Feedback and critique

This is a learning project, not a finished product. If you think the analysis
is wrong, misleading, or missing something important — **please say so.**
You can leave comments on any page using the comment box at the bottom,
or open an issue on GitHub.

I'm especially interested in:

- Methodological objections (Am I using the right measures? The right comparisons?)
- Missing context (What important literature am I ignoring?)
- Data limitations I haven't acknowledged
- Alternative interpretations of the same data
